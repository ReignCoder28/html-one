    <h1>Long Road</h1>
    <p>
        My favorite childhood memory would be when me and my mom would go
        To our uncle's house out in fresno. it would be a long car trip that usually
        went past night. I would always look out of the window looking at the stars 
        if I did not fall asleep. we would always bring the two dog's with us. 
        One of the best parts about it was the quiet or music filled atmasphere
        that was always created when we would go especily when we got there.
